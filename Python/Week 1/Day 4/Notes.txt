
Operation	Description
a + b	Sum of a and b
a - b	Difference between a and b
a * b	Product of a and b
a / b	Quotient of a and b
a // b	
Floored quotient of a and b. Returns an integer value that was implicitly converted from a floating point value.
For example, 8 / 5 = 1.6, when implicitly converted all digits fall away after the dot (.), 8 // 5 = 1

a % b	Remainder of a / b (modular operator)
-a	a negated
+a	a unchanged

Operation	Description
abs(a)	Absolute value or magnitude of a
int(a)	a converted to integer
float(a)	a converted to floating point
complex(re, imag)	A complex number with real part re, imaginary part imag. imag defaults to zero if not specified.
divmod(a, b)	The pair (a // b, a % b)
pow(a, b)	a to the power b
a ** b	a to the power b

math.trunc(a)	a truncated to Integral
round(a	a rounded to the nearest integer
math.floor(a)	The greatest integral float <= a
math.ceil(a)	The least integral float
